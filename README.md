# Fruit-Recognition-System-using-CNN
It is an easy Fruit Recognition Ssytem made by the help of CNN.

- The project aims to develop a fruit recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). 
- The system will take images of various fruits as input and classify them into their respective categories. 
- The CNN model will be trained on a large dataset of fruit images using transfer learning to improve accuracy and efficiency. 
- The system will be designed to work in real-time, with the potential to be integrated into a mobile application or a smart refrigerator to assist with grocery shopping and inventory management. 
- The results of this project have the potential to significantly impact the fruit industry and improve the overall user experience in terms of convenience and efficiency.
